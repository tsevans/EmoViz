# EmoViz
CS 4624 Hypertext, Multimedia, and Information Access Capstone semester project.
EmoViz is an application for visualizing FACS emotion data generated from the Noldus FaceReader software. 

## Client Background
Our client is [Professor Steven D. Sheetz](https://acis.pamplin.vt.edu/directory/Sheetz.html), a Professor of Accounting and Information Systems in the department of Accounting and Information Systems in the Pamplin College of Business at Virginia Tech. His research focuses on sharing information including the complexity of developing information systems, group support systems, the design and use of software metrics, the effects of work pressure on IT project teams, use of social media and web archiving related to crises, and affective decision-making.
Professor Sheetz approached our team with a set of data from an experiment in which students watched a simulation of a fradulent business audit while their faces were recorded with the Noldus FaceReader software. The goal of this experiment was to determine if the emotions shown through facial expressions show any indication of a person's ability to detect fraud during a business audit. Our client seeks a software tool that will provide a streamlined process for visualizing the large datasets generated during his experiment.
